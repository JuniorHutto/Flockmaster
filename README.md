# 🐏 Flockmaster

**Flockmaster** is a self-hosted, mobile-friendly web application for sheep producers, built to replace traditional spreadsheets with a modern management interface. It is specifically designed to implement the performance records and adjustment formulas provided by the **Oklahoma State University (OSU) Extension Service**.

## ✨ Features

- **OSU-Standard Logic:** Automatically calculates adjusted weaning weights (60/90/120 day) and handles Age-of-Dam multipliers.
    
- **Performance Dashboard:** Real-time metrics for flock composition, average weights, and Average Daily Gain (ADG).
    
- **Lineage Tracking:** Deep-link lambs to sires and dams for better genetic selection.
    
- **Health Management:** Log vaccinations and treatments with built-in withdrawal date tracking.
    
- **Home-Lab Ready:** Optimized for Docker and Proxmox environments.
    

## 🚀 Quick Start

The fastest way to get Flockmaster running is via Docker:

Bash

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Once running, visit `http://localhost:port` to start managing your flock.
